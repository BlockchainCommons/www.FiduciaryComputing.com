title: Fiduciary Computing
---

> ***Fiduciary Computing*** is a people-first digital paradigm that empowers individuals and families to control their digital destiny, and to uphold their human dignity online. It actively champions the interests of people and their families in personal security, privacy, resilience, and data protection, and cultivates an engaging ecosystem they can proactively cooperate with each other, other collectives, and platforms. In doing so, it not only bolsters their autonomy and rights but also significantly reduces their vulnerability in the digital realm.

## Your Digital Journey

Picture yourself aboard a grand ship sailing the vast digital ocean. Despite being the rightful owner, you are not the captain, but a passenger. The ship's course, the ports of call, and even the choice of companion vessels are dictated not by you, but by distant corporations. They exact a continuous "toll" from you, not always in gold, but often in your personal data or by compelling you to relinquish your rights.

### From Passenger to Captain

Reflect on the times you've felt adrift in your own digital vessel, with tech giants acting as unchosen captains, steering your course and dictating the toll. Fiduciary Computing empowers you to become the captain of your digital ship, giving you the autonomy to chart your course, control your personal data, and navigate digital interactions free of an unending toll.

### The Promise of Fiduciary Computing

Fiduciary Computing is the beacon of change that elevates you from passenger to captain, putting you firmly at the helm of your digital journey. Drawing its ethos from profession ethics in medicine, law, and financial advisory services, where fiduciary duties are sacred, Fiduciary Computing demands that digital tools and services serve you, the individuals and families as their primary responsibility. Rooted in people-first principles, Fiduciary Computing empowers you to control your digital journey, actively championing you interests in personal security, privacy, data protection and resilience.

### Your Device, Your First Mate

Imagine your smartphone as more than just a device—it's your first mate, your advocate. Your device is transformed into a skilled negotiator in the digital marketplace of the high seas. It enables cooperation with other people, pooling your collective bargaining power to negotiate even better terms, just as a flotilla of ships might command more respect than a lone vessel.

### Beyond Individual Empowerment

Fiduciary Computing champions a cooperative digital ecosystem, where we, as digital captains, can band together to protect our interests against more formidable adversaries.

### The Call to Action

Fiduciary Computing is not just a concept—it's a movement. It's a call to action to transform our digital seascape to prioritize the user. It's the promise of a future where technology serves us unconditionally, where our digital journeys are not dictated by distant owners of our ships, but shaped by our choices and needs. Most importantly, it's a future where technology remembers its ultimate duty: to serve and protect you, ensuring the helm of your digital ship always remains in your hands.
